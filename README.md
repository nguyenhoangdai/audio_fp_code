This repository contains the code used for our IMC 2022 paper: 

**Your Speaker or My Snooper? Measuring the Effectiveness of Web Audio Browser Fingerprints.**

We created a website that hosts the fingerprinting code that we used for this project: 
https://audio-fp.web.app.

Our audio fingerprinting source code is at "code.ts" file.
